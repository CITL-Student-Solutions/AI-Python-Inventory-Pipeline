
Room and Device Information Extraction Script for Custom GPT
The room_device_info.py script is designed to support a custom GPT environment by dynamically extracting and saving information about rooms and devices from a spreadsheet. This enables GPT to respond to user questions about specific rooms and devices efficiently.
Purpose
The script allows GPT to:
	• Find Information: Search for details about specific rooms and devices based on user queries.
	• Save Filtered Data: Save results of these searches into a new file when required, allowing easy access to customized information.
This functionality is useful in environments where managing room and device data is essential, such as classroom or facility management systems.
Key Functions
1. search_room_device_info(file_path, room=None, device=None)
	• What it does:
		○ This function allows GPT to search for specific information about a room or device in the provided spreadsheet.
		○ It takes a file path to the spreadsheet and optional room and device parameters to refine the search.
	• How it works:
		○ If a user asks GPT for information about a particular room (e.g., "What devices are in room C-110?"), GPT can call this function to retrieve relevant information.
		○ The function returns details about devices in that room, or an appropriate message if no matching information is found.
	• Example Usage in GPT:
		○ "List all devices in room B-114."
		○ GPT triggers search_room_device_info with room="B-114" to gather and return the device list for that room.
2. save_room_device_info(file_path, output_path, room=None, device=None)
	• What it does:
		○ This function saves specific information about a room or device to a new file.
		○ It takes a file path for the original spreadsheet, an output path for saving the filtered data, and optional room and device parameters to define the content.
	• How it works:
		○ If a user requests to save information about certain rooms or devices, GPT can call this function to create a new file with just the relevant data.
		○ For example, if a user says, "Save the list of all projectors in room C-110," GPT uses this function to filter and save the information to a new file that the user can download.
	• Example Usage in GPT:
		○ "Save data for room C-110 to a file."
		○ GPT triggers save_room_device_info with room="C-110", which creates a new file containing only the relevant information for room C-110.
How the Script Works with GPT
	1. User Queries: The script is designed to respond to specific types of questions, such as:
		○ "What devices are available in room X?"
		○ "Save a list of devices for room Y to a file."
	2. Dynamic Responses: Based on the question, GPT will:
		○ Search for information if the user wants details on a specific room or device.
		○ Save information if the user requests to store filtered data in a new file.
	3. Data Structure: The script assumes the spreadsheet has columns for room and device information, allowing it to filter results based on user requests.
Example Responses Generated by GPT
For a Search Request:
	• User Question: "What devices are available in room C-110?"
	• GPT Response:
		○ GPT calls search_room_device_info with room="C-110".
		○ The script returns a list of devices in room C-110, which GPT formats into a readable response like:
		Devices found in room C-110:
		- Projector
		- Whiteboard
		- Computer station
		
For a Save Request:
	• User Question: "Save device info for room B-114."
	• GPT Response:
		○ GPT calls save_room_device_info with room="B-114" and an output file path.
		○ The script saves the filtered data and confirms to GPT that the file has been created.
		○ GPT’s response might be:
Data for room B-114 has been saved to "room_B-114_devices.xlsx".
Summary of Script Capabilities
	• Search for Room and Device Information: Enables GPT to quickly find and return relevant room or device information based on user requests.
	• Save Filtered Data: Allows GPT to create and save customized data files based on specific user criteria.
This script enhances GPT's ability to manage and retrieve room and device data dynamically, making it a valuable tool for environments where quick access to facility information is essential.


IDE - Based Room and Device Information Extraction Script Readme
This script is designed to load, search, and save information about rooms and devices from an Excel spreadsheet. It’s intended for use in custom GPT setups to allow dynamic querying and saving of data based on user input.
Features
	• Dynamic Searching: Search for room and device information based on user-specified criteria.
	• Data Extraction: Extract specific information (like devices in a particular room) and present it in a human-readable format.
	• Data Saving: Save filtered data to a new Excel file if required.
	• GPT Integration: Can be integrated into custom GPT setups to respond to user queries about room and device information.
Requirements
	• Python 3.x
	• pandas library for data manipulation
	• openpyxl library for Excel file handling
Install the necessary libraries using:
pip install pandas openpyxl
File Structure
	• room_device_info.py: Main Python script containing the RoomDeviceInfo class and helper functions.
	• README.md: This README file.
Script Components
RoomDeviceInfo Class
	• __init__(file_path): Initializes the class with the path to the Excel file.
	• load_data(): Loads the data from the Excel file into a DataFrame.
	• search_info(room, device): Searches for information based on room and/or device criteria.
	• save_filtered_data(output_path, room, device): Saves filtered information to a new Excel file.
Helper Functions
These functions are defined to interact with the GPT system dynamically.
	• search_room_device_info(file_path, room=None, device=None): Searches for specific room/device information and returns the results.
	• save_room_device_info(file_path, output_path, room=None, device=None): Saves filtered room/device information to a specified file.
Usage Guide
1. Load the Script
To use this script, place the room_device_info.py file in your project directory.
2. Initialize the Class
To start using the script, initialize the RoomDeviceInfo class with the path to your Excel file containing room and device data.
Example:
from room_device_info import RoomDeviceInfo
# Initialize with the Excel file path
file_path = "path_to_your_spreadsheet.xlsx"
room_device_info = RoomDeviceInfo(file_path)
3. Search for Room and Device Information
To search for specific room or device information, use the search_room_device_info function. You can specify a room, a device, or both.
Example:
# Search for a projector in room C-110
result = room_device_info.search_info(room="C-110", device="projector")
print(result)
